# CSS Color Markers

A simple and visually appealing web page that demonstrates the use of CSS to create color markers with gradient effects and box shadows. The project includes an HTML structure to display three different colored markers (red, green, and blue), each featuring a cap and sleeve created using CSS styles.

## Features:
- **HTML Structure**: A clean, minimal layout consisting of a heading and three markers.
- **CSS Styling**:
  - Each marker is styled using gradients, creating a realistic marker effect with a cap and a sleeve.
  - The colors of the markers are defined using CSS linear gradients and box-shadow properties, enhancing the visual effect.
  - The markers are designed to be responsive with proper margins and padding for a clean presentation.

## How It Works:
- The `index.html` file structures the page by including three marker elements inside a container.
- The `styles.css` file applies the colors and effects using gradients for the cap and sleeve of each marker. The markers are designed to look like real markers, with each color having a unique gradient combination and shadow effect.

## Purpose:
This project showcases the power of CSS for creating simple yet visually dynamic components that can be used for web design. It can serve as a basic example for learning about CSS gradients, shadows, and layouts.
